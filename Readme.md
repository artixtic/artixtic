## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Senior Flutter Engineer** with **5+ years of experience** building scalable, high‑performance mobile applications and end‑to‑end product solutions. My core expertise lies in **Flutter & Dart**, complemented by strong experience in **Android (Kotlin)** and backend technologies like **Node.js, NestJS, and Laravel**.

I’ve worked on complex domains including **Smart Home Automation, IoT ecosystems, real‑time communication, multimedia apps, and enterprise‑scale solutions**. I enjoy solving hard engineering problems—performance optimization, architecture design, system reliability, and seamless cross‑platform user experiences.

I’ve led projects from **idea to production**, implemented **CI/CD pipelines**, written automated tests, mentored teams, and collaborated with both **Pakistan‑based and U.S. remote teams**. I value clean architecture, clear communication, and continuous learning.
